# CALL-E API Notes For Verification Workflows

Empirically observed behaviors this skill relies on, recorded from live testing in July 2026. Where the observed API differs from documentation, the observation is stated plainly so the skill keeps working.

## Terminal payload shape (observed live)

`GET /v1/calls/{id}` returns a snake_case `call_task` object. The fields that matter for verification:

```text
status                        queued | completed | failed | canceled
task_completed                boolean, whether the stated goal was achieved
completion_confidence         {score: float, label: string}
evidence                      list of short claim strings about the call
summary                       human-readable outcome summary
recipients[].attempts[].transcript_turns[]
                              {offset_seconds, speaker: bot|user, text}
recipients[].structured_result   null unless a result schema was applied
```

`transcript_turns` is the extraction surface: per-turn speaker labels with second offsets, which is what makes span grounding and audio-synchronized highlighting possible.

## Result schema parameters (observed rejection)

As of late July 2026 the live API rejects both `result_schema` and `recipient_result_schema` on `POST /v1/calls` with "... is not supported", even though the Python SDK exposes both parameters. This skill therefore never depends on provider-side structured results: extraction happens client-side from the transcript, which also keeps every answer span-grounded. If the schema parameters start working, note that `summary` is a reserved field name inside `recipient_result_schema` and will be rejected; use `notes`.

## Idempotency

`Idempotency-Key` on call creation is honored: resubmitting with the same key returns the same call instead of dialing twice. `place_verify_call.py` prints its generated key so a retry after a network failure can reuse it safely.

## Webhooks

Terminal webhooks are signed with HMAC-SHA256 over `timestamp + "." + raw_body`, delivered in `CALL-E-Signature: v1=<hex>` with a `CALL-E-Timestamp` header. The SDK's verifier checks the signature but not timestamp freshness, so verifiers should enforce their own replay window over the exact raw bytes before parsing.

## Billing behaviors relevant to verification runs

Per public statements from the CALL-E team: no-answer calls and failed routes are not billed; voicemail and low-confidence results bill the call fee only. A verification sweep over stale listings, where many numbers are dead, is therefore cheaper than the raw listing count suggests.

## Capabilities to not assume

No call cancellation, no inbound answering, no mid-call developer tool use, no real-time transcript streaming. DTMF phone-tree navigation exists platform-side but is not yet generally available; do not build verification flows that require reliable IVR traversal.
